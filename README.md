# ByteLink

One day a friend of mine sent me a long link with all sort of charachters that tskaes up the whole phone screen, so I thought about creating this solution:
  ByteLink is a modern, minimalistic URL shortener.  
  It allows users to quickly shorten long URLs and share them with ease.  
  The app features a beautiful UI, developer profile, and seamless clipboard copy functionality.

## Features

- ✂️ Shorten long URLs instantly
- 📋 One-click copy to clipboard
- ⚡ Fast, responsive, and mobile-friendly design
- 👤 Developer profile
- 🌈 Modern UI with minimalistic aesthetics
- 🔒 Built with  
    ✨ Frontend: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and a LOT OF Lucide icons
    ⚙️ Backend: .NET Core, ASP.NET Core, C#, SQL SERVER...
